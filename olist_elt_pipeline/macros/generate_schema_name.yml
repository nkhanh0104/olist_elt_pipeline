      ðŸŽ¯ Dynamically generate the schema name for a dbt resource (model, seed, snapshot)
      based on defined configuration rules. Helps organize resources into logical schemas
      for better structure, modularity, and CI/CD hygiene.

      ðŸ§  Order of precedence:
        1. Custom schema explicitly defined in the resource (e.g. `+schema:` or `config(schema=...)`)
        2. Exception: `dbt_project_evaluator_exception` gets its own schema
        3. Package-specific: resources from `dbt_project_evaluator` get their own schema
        4. Package-specific: resources from `elementary` get their own schema
        5. Default fallback to `target.schema` (as defined in dbt profile)

        description: ðŸŽ¯ Schema explicitly defined via config. If none is set, falls back to rule-based logic.

        description: ðŸŽ¯ The current dbt node (model, seed, etc.) being processed â€” includes name, type, and package metadata.
