      🧠 Macro to generate a dynamic `WHERE` clause that filters `dim_dates` by year, quarter, month, and day
      based on runtime `var()` inputs. It helps ensure consistent filtering logic across multiple fact models
      (e.g., revenue, churn, payments) without manual date slicing.

      ✅ Supports flexible granularity filtering based on vars:
        - year (required for all granularities)
        - quarter (mutually exclusive with month/day)
        - month (must accompany year)
        - day (must accompany month and year)

      🛡️ Includes compiler-level validation to prevent invalid combinations (e.g., quarter + month, or day without month).

      📊 Use in conjunction with `dim_dates` to support dashboards that need dynamic date filters via Metabase or Airflow.

          ✅ Run with CLI to filter by full date (year, month, day):
        code: |
          dbt run --select fct_revenue_by_state --vars '{year: 2018, month: 7, day: 15}'

      - name: cli_example_quarter_only
        description: >
          ✅ Run with CLI to filter by quarter:
        code: |
          dbt run --select fct_revenue_by_state --vars '{year: 2018, quarter: 2}'

      - name: cli_error_invalid_combo
        description: >
          ❌ Invalid: quarter and month/day used together → raises compiler error:
        code: |
          dbt run --vars '{year: 2018, quarter: 3, month: 7}'
